# 🤖 Eka-Botto

**Eka-Botto** is my first Telegram bot project!  
It’s a simple group management bot built using **Python** and the **Pyrogram** library.

## 💬 A Note from the Creator

This is my **first Telegram bot**, made while learning Python and Telegram APIs.  
It's still a work in progress, and I’m always open to feedback or suggestions!

A few features are currently not functioning as expected — fixes are in progress and will be released soon.
